Automatic constructor of the API doesn't work, use this:

There are still some bugs relating to installation so do note that, in order to launch it you need to launch the API separatly with
python -m fastapi dev api.py
And the database with:
docker-compose up --build db

expending the database would be beneficial in the future.

The security of the database is minimal.

But appart from that, take the project in any direction you want!
